# dev_design
Hiiii, I'm new here and recently I'm learning Android code!
Currently I am a graduate student of interaction design.
I learn from Udacity's Google lectures about Android for Beginners.

I will put some of my works of android XML, java and ui design here.
Hope people can share some ideas with me! Thnx
